# Kozo Documentation

_Kōzō_ (構造) is an open-source [infrastructure as code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) tool to manage your cloud resources.
It leverages the power and flexibility of the [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/) programming language to let you declare your infrastructure in your favourite language.

Create, change, delete and version your infrastructural cloud resources such as networks, servers and DNS records.
Kozo makes sure that your cloud resources always match the configuration you have defined in your Kozo files.
